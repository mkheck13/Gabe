        Gabe Newell, also known by his nickname Gaben, is an American businessman who is the president of the video game company Valve.
        He worked for Microsoft in the 1980’s and 90’s where he helped create the first versions of the windows operating system.
        He left Microsoft in 1996 to found Valve, and started work on their first game, Half-Life.
        He is an influential person to me because he had a vision and has continued to build upon that.
        Steam has kept pc gaming viable as a gaming platform and in recent years has also made it viable in the handheld gaming market as well.</pre>
